Project Title: Predictive Analytics and Readmission Analysis for Diabetes Management

Description:

Developed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for diabetes management, incorporating advanced data imputation, predictive modeling, and readmission analysis. 
Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation to handle missing values in clinical features, resulting in a more robust and accurate dataset.
Trained a Logistic Regression model for diabetes prediction, achieving 76% accuracy, with detailed evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. 
Conducted an in-depth readmission analysis for diabetic patients using a secondary dataset, focusing on the impact of HbA1c measurements and medication changes on readmission rates. 
Performed bivariate and trivariate analyses to uncover significant insights regarding the relationship between HbA1c levels, medication changes, primary diagnoses, and readmission rates. 
Visualized key findings using heatmaps and clustered bar plots to communicate the importance of regular HbA1c monitoring and proactive medication adjustments. Key Skills:

Impact:

Enhanced predictive accuracy for diabetes management, aiding in early intervention and treatment. 
Identified critical factors affecting hospital readmissions, providing evidence-based recommendations for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. 
Demonstrated the utility of advanced data imputation and analysis techniques in a healthcare setting, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring and proactive management of diabetic patients.
